Whether you are a graphic designer, photographer, illustrator, or scientist, GIMP provides you with sophisticated tools to get your job done. You can further enhance your productivity with GIMP thanks to many customization options and 3rd party plugins.

## H

[**Hashcat**](https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat) hashcat is the world's fastest and most advanced password recovery utility, supporting five unique modes of attack for over 200 highly-optimized hashing algorithms. hashcat currently supports CPUs, GPUs, and other hardware accelerators on Linux, Windows, and macOS, and has facilities to help enable distributed password cracking.


## K

[**Kore**](https://github.com/jorisvink/kore) is an easy to use web application framework for writing scalable web APIs in C. Its main goals are security, scalability and allowing rapid development and deployment of such APIs.

## L

[**libuv**](https://github.com/libuv/libuv) is a multi-platform support library with a focus on asynchronous I/O. It was primarily developed for use by Node.js, but it's also used by Luvit, Julia, pyuv, and others.

Feature highlights:

 * Full-featured event loop backed by epoll, kqueue, IOCP, event ports.
 * Asynchronous TCP and UDP sockets
 * Asynchronous DNS resolution
 * Asynchronous file and file system operations
 * File system events
 * ANSI escape code controlled TTY
 * IPC with socket sharing, using Unix domain sockets or named pipes (Windows)
 * Child processes
 * Thread pool
 * Signal handling
 * High resolution clock
 * Threading and synchronization primitives

[**Lwan**](https://github.com/lpereira/lwan/) is a high-performance & scalable web server for glibc/Linux
platforms.

In development for almost 4 years, Lwan was until now a personal research
effort that focused mostly on building a **solid infrastructure** for
a lightweight and speedy web server:

  - Low memory footprint (~500KiB for 10k idle connections)
  - Minimal memory allocations & copies
  - Minimal system calls
  - Hand-crafted HTTP request parser
  - Files are served using the most efficient way according to their size
    - No copies between kernel and userland for files larger than 16KiB
    - Smaller files are sent using vectored I/O of memory-mapped buffers
    - Header overhead is considered before compressing small files
  - Mostly wait-free multi-threaded design
  - Diminute code base with roughly 7200 lines of C code

It is now transitioning into a fully working, capable HTTP server. It is
not, however, as feature-packed as other popular web servers. But it is
[free software](http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html), so scratching
your own itches and making Lwan hum the way you want it to is possible.

## N

[**Nchan**](https://github.com/slact/nchan) is a scalable, flexible pub/sub server for the modern web, built as a module for the Nginx web server. It can be configured as a standalone server, or as a shim between your application and hundreds, thousands, or millions of live subscribers. It can buffer messages in memory, on-disk, or via Redis. All connections are handled asynchronously and distributed among any number of worker processes. It can also scale to many Nginx servers with Redis.

[**netdata**](https://github.com/firehol/netdata) is a system for distributed real-time performance and health monitoring. It provides unparalleled insights, in real-time, of everything happening on the system it runs (including applications such as web and database servers), using modern interactive web dashboards.

netdata is fast and efficient, designed to permanently run on all systems (physical & virtual servers, containers, IoT devices), without disrupting their core function.

[**NumPy**](https://github.com/numpy/numpy) is the fundamental package needed for scientific computing with Python.
This package contains:

   * a powerful N-dimensional array object
   * sophisticated (broadcasting) functions
   * tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran code
   * useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities.

It derives from the old Numeric code base and can be used as a replacement for Numeric. It also adds the features introduced by numarray and can be used to replace numarray.


## S

[**SDL**](https://www.libsdl.org/) (Simple DirectMedia Layer) is a cross-platform development library designed to provide low level access to audio, keyboard, mouse, joystick, and graphics hardware via OpenGL and Direct3D. It is used by video playback software, emulators, and popular games including Valve's award winning catalog and many Humble Bundle games. Officially supports Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, iOS, and Android. Support for other platforms may be found in the source code. SDL 2.0 is distributed under the zlib license. This license allows you to use SDL freely in any software.
