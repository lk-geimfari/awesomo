[**AREG SDK**](https://github.com/aregtech/areg-sdk/) is an interface-centric real-time asynchronous communication engine to enable [distributed-](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_computing) and [mist-](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/500-325/final)computing, where Things interact and provide services, as if they act like thin distributed servers.

Traditionally, devices are connected clients to stream data to the cloud or fog servers for further processing. Since data is generated and collected at the edge of the network (mist network), it makes sense to change the role of connected Things and provide network accessible (_Public_) services directly on devices. This extends _Cloud_ to the extreme edge.

## B

[**Bitcoin**](https://bitcoin.org/) is an innovative payment network and a new kind of money. Bitcoin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority or banks; managing transactions and the issuing of bitcoins is carried out collectively by the network.

Through many of its unique properties, Bitcoin allows exciting uses that could not be covered by any previous payment system.

[**Lithium**](https://github.com/matt-42/lithium) is the fastest open-source HTTP framework written in c++17. Lithium HTTP server and SQL drivers are benchmarked againts 200+ other framesworks at [TechEmpower](https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks) . As of November 2020, it is ranked first. Pre-2010 C++ was a pretty low-level language and zero-runtime-cost abstractions where only possible using complex template meta-programming tricks. The C++ standard committee addressed those issues by publishing new C++ standard, making C++ programs much more simpler and fun to write. These recent language evolutions has created inside the language a C++ subset that is easy to grasp for beginners and less error prone than C++ itself: using RAII instead of manual memory management, using constexpr instead of template meta-programming, etc...
Could this subset of C++ lead to a web framework that is as easy to grasp than javascript alternatives while keeping the performances of C++ ?
The goal of Lithium is to prove that this is feasible.
