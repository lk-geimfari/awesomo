[**Druid**](https://github.com/druid-io/druid) is a distributed, column-oriented, real-time analytics data store that is commonly used to power exploratory dashboards in multi-tenant environments.

Druid excels as a data warehousing solution for fast aggregate queries on petabyte sized data sets. Druid supports a variety of flexible filters, exact calculations, approximate algorithms, and other useful calculations.

Druid can load both streaming and batch data and integrates with Samza, Kafka, Storm, Spark, and Hadoop.

## E

[**Encon**](https://github.com/appulse-projects/encon-java) - is a Java library, **E**rlang **N**ode **CON**nector, which allows your `JVM` app to duplex interact with `Erlang` or `Elixir` nodes. It is based on [Erlang Distribution Protocol](http://erlang.org/doc/apps/erts/erl_dist_protocol.html) and provides a convenient way to work with its components. The project consists of different sub-modules, start from basic elements like Erlang term serialization/deserialization, continue to Erlang distribution protocol itself and end with data mapping and Spring integration.

## S

[**Spring Boot**](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot) makes it easy to create Spring-powered, production-grade applications and services with absolute minimum fuss. It takes an opinionated view of the Spring platform so that new and existing users can quickly get to the bits they need. You can use Spring Boot to create stand-alone Java applications that can be started using java -jar or more traditional WAR deployments. We also provide a command line tool that runs spring scripts.
